We took GPS data from Paul at three different points in the oval from the /filtered_pos topic published by roscopter. The data is stored in three bagfiles (in arl-scope/bagfiles). All three filenames begin with 'gps_data'. The first 15 minutes of data in each bagfile were recorded with a stationary quadcopter. Any data after the 15 minute mark is not guaranteed to be good, as I mistakenly moved the quadcopter before killing the rosbag process.
