Base of Great Lawn, with Malificent, testing hover in place. Sunny and cold
  - The plan is to fly a GEF path and, after sending each waypoint, tell the quad to hover in place after 3 seconds

1. The quadcopter launched successfully, headed towards G, then after 3-4 seconds lurched and came back the launch point

2. Commented out hover in place to see whether current_lat/long looked correct over time. The quadcopter correctly flew GEF and the positions looked correct

3. Same as flight 1. Took control and flew back after LAND command sent

4. Added more print statements, but there was a typo. Sent G waypoint and errored out, landed by hand

5. Same as flight 1. When trying to fly a GEF point the quadcopter will send a waypoint, head to that waypoint, jerk after 3-4 seconds and head back to where it was a couple of seconds ago. HYPOTHESIS: the Hover waypoint is lagging a couple seconds, so if we wait 3s between the first waypoint sent and the hover waypoint sent the quadcopter appears to go back to the launch point.

6. Increased the wait between waypoint sent and hover waypoint sent from 3s to 5s. The quadcopter
		a. Gets sent to a waypoint (e.g. G)
		b. 5 seconds later, sends a hover waypoint. The hover waypoint is behind the quadcopter by a couple seconds, according to where the quadcopter went

Conclusion: The GPS and compass data appear to be laggy. We should measure by how much they lag.
