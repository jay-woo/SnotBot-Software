AT THE LOWER CORNER OF THE GREAT LAWN, KYLE AND ERIC
IN THE SNOW

We are trying to test hover_in_place on the feature/hover_in_place branch. There
are two possibilities we're testing:
	1) Does just clearing the waypoints make it hover?
	2) If not, can we send a waypoint at the current point to make it stop?

CAN WE JUST CLEAR WAYPOINTS TO MAKE THE QUAD STOP?
1. Armed and launched correctly, Malificent seems to launching very high. Copter started heading towards waypoint, and when waypoints were cleared it appeared to head back to the landing site, we took control and landed
2. Armed, launched, started to WP1 (E5) and when cleared the copter went back to the launch point (same x, y, still high). The copter didn't go to the second WP (F5), but it said the WP sent correctly

CAN WE SEND WP TO THE CURRENT POSITION?
1. Tried to do this, but the code crashed and Kyle took manual control. When landing, the quadcopter pitched a fit during disarming and flipped itself into the snow. When we power cycled, the quadcopter wouldn't turn on with battery and then power off. Our guess was that it was wet and a safety cutoff was kicking in to prevent a short. Went inside to dry the quadcopter
