1. a, b, c success!

2. launched toward A, drifted a bit (ior a lot), then went to the waypoints

3. didnt go to a,went to b and c

4. turtled

5. a,b,c all visited, good launch and land. yay!

------added check to see if waypoint sewnt correctly. 

6. visited all wayppoionts, 2nd waypoiint sent twice

7. happiness. good launch, a, b, c visited, landed happy


------ Eric is out with Drew to test altitude + hold_time --------
1. Tried launching the quadcopter and it headed directly towards the dorms. Drew took control and brought it down. The quadcopter took control away from him every time it sent a waypoint

2. Launched fine and took off agressively in the direction of C. Not sure if it was going to C or drifting

3. Launched fine and took off agressively in the direction of C. Not sure if it was going to C or drifting. AFTER DOING THIS I CLEARED THE WAYPOINTS.

4. Launched well, drifted towards MH and hovered over the sidewalk while in Launch. Failed five times to send A, sent B correctly, sent C correctly.

5. Launched successfully and went to the same point as in previous run - over the sidewalk towards the MH. Hovered there. Got a low battery signal, we landed by hand.

6. Repowered from last run. Cleared the waypoints manually. Successfully launched, went to C at 9.0 m, want to B at 6.0m, then failed to go to A at 3.0 m. Potentially a height cutoff on waypoints.

7. Launched successfully and hovered 3-5m away from the launch point. Went to A at 6m, went to B at 5m, failed to go to C at 4m.

-- MAKE THE JSON PATH RELATIVE - rosrun quadcopter fails if not in correct directory
-- SEARCH FOR THE 5m HARD LIMIT ON HEIGHT
-- HOLD TIME IS UNSUCCESSFUL BECAUSE WE OVERWRITE IT AT 15s. LOOK INTO SENDING WAYPOINT LISTS


8. 9. Tests 8 and 9 successfully went to A at 5m and failed at B at 4.5m and 4.9m, successively. There seems to be a 5m limit on waypoint height.

10. Launched and went to A, the last waypoint. I did NOT clear waypoints in between runs, which seemed to cause this failure. The quadcopter successfully went to A-B-C-D-F-E-G. It turned violently from G to B, possibly because it was turning 180 degrees.

11. Launch failed, slid sideways, tilted down, and crashed

12. DID NOT CLEAR WAYPOINT MANUALLY. Launch went to A (it shouldn't have done this). Quadcopter successfully went C-A-C-A-C-A. It did not do the wild turn that we saw two tests ago.

13. Tried to bump throttle to half to get batter takeoff, quadcopter still drifted on takeoff. I DID clear wapyoints manually, but it still headed to A on launch. Successfully did A5-B10-C5

14. Cleared waypoints manually, launched at half throttle, took off perfectly, landed manually. Quadcopter flipped after landing due to props spinnning.

15. 16. Flew C5-B10-A5 and C5-C10-A10-A5 correctly.

ASSUME THAT THERE WERE 3 LAUNCH FAILURES ENDING IN CRASHES THAT WE FORGOT TO RECORD

-- TRY TO SEND WAYPOINTS AS A LIST
-- MAKE SURE CLEAR_WAYPOINTS IS HAPPENING CORRECTLY

///////////////////////////////
Test flights! We made a diamond and ran it 1-3-2-4, placed cones underneath where the quadcopter paused.
	{"Test1": {"latitude": 42.2929104, "longitude": -71.2630701, "altitude": 5},
	 "Test2": {"latitude": 42.2928398, "longitude": -71.2629666, "altitude": 5},
	 "Test3": {"latitude": 42.2927655, "longitude": -71.2629273, "altitude": 5},
	 "Test4": {"latitude": 42.2927511, "longitude": -71.2630641, "altitude": 5}}

Test1: Flipped on launch an we lost signal, power cycled

Test2: (About 10 minutes after we took waypoints) Correctly ran the waypoints. The first point was way off (5m?) but the others were good. Maybe took Test1 waypoint badly. Retook the point and recorded it.
BAD WAYPOINT 1? 42.2927957, -71.2631073

Test3: Launched and went to the last waypoint, even when we cleared waypoints manually. Is again WAY off on the first test waypoint, even after we re-took it.
BAD WAYPOINT 1? 42.2929104, -71.2630701

ERRORS OFF THE POINTS, IN METERS
Test1: 9 SW
Test1 Retake: 8.5 N
Test2: 0.28 N, 1.07 NNW
Test3: 2.35 NNW, 2.05 SE
Test4: 1.1 N, 2.45 N
